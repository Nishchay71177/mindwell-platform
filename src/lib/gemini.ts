  "Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now. One technique that many students find helpful is the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding exercise: name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, and 1 you can taste. This can help when feeling anxious or overwhelmed.",
  
  "I hear you, and your feelings are completely valid. Academic pressure can be really intense. Have you considered breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks? Sometimes when everything feels overwhelming, focusing on just the next small step can make a big difference.",
  
  "It's great that you're taking time to check in with yourself. Self-awareness is such an important part of mental wellness. How has your sleep been lately? Getting quality rest can have a huge impact on how we feel and cope with stress.",
  
  "I'm glad you're reaching out. Remember that it's okay to not be okay sometimes. What's one small thing you could do today to take care of yourself? It could be as simple as taking a short walk, listening to your favorite song, or reaching out to a friend.",
